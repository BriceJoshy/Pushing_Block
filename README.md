The pushing block project implemented in Unreal Engine .


The pushing block project implemented in Unreal Engine is a simple 3D game where the player has to push a block(literally).This uses basic physics and logic. The game includes a player-controlled character and a moveable block object that can be pushed in different directions. The game world is designed using Unreal Engine's 3D rendering capabilities.
The player's movements are controlled by input from the keyboard. The block's movements are governed by physics and collision detection.
